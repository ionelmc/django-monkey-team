===========================
    django-monkey-team
===========================

This is a middleware that displays debug tracebacks on production sites (where
you would have `DEBUG = False`) only to developers. Developers have to install a
special userscript to decode the traceback data. AES-256 (CBC mode) is used to
encrypt the traceback. The decode key and client key are hashes of your 
SECRET_KEY with salts so your SECRET_KEY is safe even if your userscript gets in 
the wrong place.

Google Chrome and Firefox are supported. If you want to use something else you
have to find a way to install the userscript yourself.

There's also a decode page in the admin in case you get user reports with the 
encrypted data.

The error page and decrypt flow looks like this:

Installation guide
==================

Install it::

    pip install django-monkey-team

Change your Django project settings to have::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'monkey_team',
    )
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += (
        'monkey_team.middleware.MonkeyTeamMiddleware',
    )
    DEBUG = False

Note, that if you want `DEBUG = True` and still have the middleware on you need to set::

    MONKEY_FORCE_ACTIVE = True

Then go to django admin and install the userscript. The setup page looks like
this:
